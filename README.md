Project Title: Hangman Game (Structured and Object-Oriented)

Description:
This project is a Python implementation of the classic Hangman game, created in two different styles:

1. Structured Programming (Single-player): In this version, the game follows a procedural approach. A single player guesses letters to complete a hidden word. The game provides feedback on each guess, tracking the remaining attempts and revealing the correct letters as the player progresses.


2. Object-Oriented Programming (Multiplayer): This version of the game uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game allows multiple players to participate, with each taking turns to guess letters. The game logic is encapsulated within classes, improving code organization and reusability. Players can compete against each other, and the game tracks each playerâ€™s attempts separately.



Both versions provide a fun and engaging way to practice Python, with a clear demonstration of structured programming versus object-oriented programming techniques.

Technologies Used:

Python

Structured Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
